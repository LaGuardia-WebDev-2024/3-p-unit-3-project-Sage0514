    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with cold water. Salt the water, then cut potatoes in
        half and place them in the pot. Bring the water to a boil and cook the
        potatoes until tender throughout, this takes roughly 40-50 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the potatoes from the water one at a time with a slotted spoon.
        Drain any excess water. Place each potato piece on a large cutting board
        and peel it before moving on to the next potato. Save the potato water.
        Also, peel each potato as soon as possible after removing from the water
        (without burning yourself) - I've found a paring knife comes in handy
        here. Be mindful that you want to work relatively quickly so you can
        mash the potatoes when they are hot. To do this you can either push the
        potatoes through a ricer, or do what I do, deconstruct them one at a
        time on the cutting board using the tines of a fork - mash isn't quite
        the right term here. I run the fork down the sides of the peeled potato
        creating a nice, fluffy potato base to work with (see photo). Don't
        over-mash - you are simply after an even texture with no noticeable
        lumps.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the potatoes cool spread out across your work surface for ten or
        fifteen minutes. Long enough that the egg won't cook when it is
        incorporated into the potatoes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <strong> Make Gnocchi:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When you're ready, pull the potatoes into a soft mound. Drizzle with the
        beaten egg and sprinkle 3/4 cup of the flour across the top. I've found
        that a metal spatula or large pastry scraper are both great utensils to
        use to incorporate the flour and eggs into the potatoes with the egg
        incorporated throughout - you can see the hint of yellow from the yolk.
        Scrape underneath and fold, scrape and fold until the mixture is a light
        crumble. Very gently, with a feathery touch knead the dough. This is
        also the point you can add more flour (a sprinkle at a time) if the
        dough is too tacky. I usually end up using most of the remaining 1/4 cup
        flour, but it all depends on the potatoes, the flour, the time of year,
        the weather, and whether the gnocchi gods are smiling on you. The dough
        should be moist but not sticky. It should feel almost billowy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut it into 8 pieces. Now gently roll each 1/8th of dough into a
        snake-shaped log, roughly the thickness of your thumb. Use a knife to
        cut pieces every 3/4-inch (see photo). Dust with a bit more flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        To shape the gnocchi hold a fork in one hand (see photo) and place a
        gnocchi pillow against the tines of the fork (or gnocchi board), cut
        ends out. With confidence and an assertive (but very light) touch, use
        your thumb and press in and down the length of the fork. The gnocchi
        should curl into a slight "C" shape, their backs will capture the
        impression of the tines as tiny ridges (good for catching sauce later).
        Set each gnocchi aside, dust with a bit more flour if needed, until you
        are ready to boil them. This step takes some practice, don't get
        discouraged, once you get the hang of it it's easy.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <strong> Boil the Gnocchi and Serve:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Now that you're on the final stretch, either reheat your potato water or
        start with a fresh pot (salted), and bring to a boil. Cook the gnocchi
        in batches by dropping them into the boiling water roughly twenty at a
        time. They will let you know when they are cooked because they will pop
        back up to the top. Fish them out of the water a few at a time with a
        slotted spoon ten seconds or so after they've surfaced. Have a large
        platter ready with a generous swirl of whatever sauce or favorite pesto
        you'll be serving on the gnocchi. Place the gnocchi on the platter.
        Continue cooking in batches until all the gnocchi are done. Gently toss
        with more sauce or pesto. Don't overdo it, it should be a light
        coverage. Serve immediately, family-style with a drizzle of good olive
        oil on top.
      </li>

      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage,

      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of
        salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat

      <li>
        Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl mix together flour, salt, ricotta and water with hands. At
        first the dough may seem sticky, but work the dough squeezing it
        together for about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 2 minutes the dough should be relatively formed together – enough
        that you can make a big ball.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for another 1-2 minutes.
        This helps the dough to become much smoother.
      </li>
      <li>Set the dough aside and add more flour to your surface.</li>
      <li>
        Take about 2 tablespoons of dough and roll into a thin strip (about ½
        inch thick)
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a scissor or knife cut the strips into small balls (smaller than a
        dime)
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss the balls with flour and then use the pasta tool or fork to shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        We use the pasta block and press firmly with our pointer or thumb,
        rolling the pasta downward. Be liberal with the flour when
        rolling/shaping!
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the cavatelli on a floured baking sheet as you’re making them –
        shaking the sheet every few minutes to make sure they’re not sticking to
        one another
      </li>
      <li>Put the cavatelli on the baking sheet in the freezer for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>
        When the cavatelli are frozen, pour them into a mesh strainer. Shake the
        excess flour off of them. *Do not skip this step, if you do you will
        wind up with gummy pasta water that is not tasty!*
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook – boil water. Add cavatelli to boiling water and cook
        for about 4-5 minutes, or until cavatelli float to the top of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, add in sauce and garnish of your choice. I suggest a creamy
        vodka sauce with oregano and basil to keep it simple.

        <li>
          In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder,
          onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. In a separate small
          bowl, lightly whisk the two eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the breadcrumb mixture, eggs, milk, Italian sausage, and ground
          beef to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together
          until evenly combined. Avoid over mixing the meat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the meatball mixture rest for five minutes to allow the
          breadcrumbs time to soften. Divide and shape the meat into about 32
          meatballs, approximately 2 Tbsp in volume each.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place
          the meatballs on the baking sheet about one inch apart from each
          other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake the meatballs for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the meatballs to a pot of red sauce and simmer for five more
          minutes in the sauce. If not using a red sauce, add an additional 3-5
          minutes to the bake time, or until the meatballs are cooked through.

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put salted water on to boil, slice the bacon, place the egg in warm
        water to bring to room temp, mince the garlic, measure out the butter,
        pepper flakes, salt, and parmesan cheese, also chop the parsley.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a food processor or blender add the egg, minced garlic, red pepper
        flakes, salt, softened butter, and parmesan cheese. Blend for about 15
        seconds until it is creamy. You may need to stop and scrape the sides
        down. Set the butter mixture aside for now.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pop the pasta in the boiling water to cook per package instructions.
        DON'T FORGET TO RESERVE ½ CUP STARCHY PASTA WATER!! Pro Tip: Place a
        measuring cup in your colander and you won't forget to reserve the
        starchy pasta water!!
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet sauté the bacon over medium heat until it is crisped
        and brown. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a paper towel lined
        plate.
      </li>
      <li>Drain all but 2 tablespoon of bacon grease from the pan.</li>
      <li>
        Add the shrimp to the bacon grease in the pan and cook over medium heat
        for about 3 minutes, just until the shrimp are a nice pink color. Remove
        the shrimp from the pan and place on the plate with the bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the now empty skillet over medium heat. Pour in ¼ cup reserved
        starchy pasta water and deglaze the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the pasta, butter/egg mixture, parsley, bacon, and shrimp. Give
        it a good toss to coat the pasta in the sauce. Pro Tip: Add more pasta
        water and parmesan cheese if you like it creamier!
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately topped with parmesan cheese and cracked black pepper.
